# Amazon Product Reviews Sentiment Analysis Using Machine Learning

This project performs **binary sentiment classification** on Amazon product reviews using machine learning algorithms. It aims to help businesses understand customer satisfaction (positive or negative) by analyzing the textual feedback customer reviews.

## Project Overview

- **Domain:** Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- **Techniques:** Text Preprocessing, TF-IDF Vectorization, Supervised Machine Learning
- **Algorithms Used:** Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbor
- **Best Accuracy:** Random Forest â€“ 90.37%

## Workflow

1. Load and clean review data
2. Preprocess text (remove HTML, punctuation, digits, etc.)
3. Convert text to vectors using TF-IDF
4. Split data into training and testing sets
5. Train 6 ML models and evaluate performance
6. Visualize results using Confusion Matrix and ROC-AUC
